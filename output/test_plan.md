**Executive Summary**

This test plan outlines the approach, objectives, and scope for testing the Cloudera Lakehouse Optimizer REST APIs. The primary focus is on ensuring the APIs meet the required functional, security, performance, and usability standards. The plan encompasses various testing areas, including functional, security, usability, performance, compatibility, error handling, integration, and regression testing.

**Test Objectives**

* Verify the Cloudera Lakehouse Optimizer REST APIs adhere to the OpenAPI specification
* Ensure the APIs correctly process requests and return expected responses
* Validate the security mechanisms in place, including authentication and authorization
* Confirm the APIs handle various types of input data and edge cases
* Assess the performance and scalability of the APIs under different loads
* Validate the APIs are accessible and usable for users with different roles and permissions
* Identify and report defects, and retest fixed issues

**Scope and Coverage**

* The scope of this test plan includes all APIs defined in the OpenAPI specification (openapi.json)
* The following APIs are in scope:
	+ /namespaces/{namespace}/policies
	+ /namespaces/active
	+ /namespaces

**Test Strategy**

* Black-box testing approach will be used, focusing on the API endpoints and their expected behavior
* Testing will be performed using a combination of manual and automated tests
* Automated tests will be developed using Postman and Newman
* Manual testing will be performed using tools like Postman and cURL
* Testing will be executed in the following environments:
	+ Development environment
	+ Staging environment
	+ Production environment
* Prioritization of tests will be based on risk and business criticality

**Test Environment**

* Development environment: Local machine with Postman and Newman installed
* Staging environment: Staging server with the Cloudera Lakehouse Optimizer REST APIs deployed
* Production environment: Production server with the Cloudera Lakehouse Optimizer REST APIs deployed
* Test data:
	+ Sample namespace data (e.g., "test", "production")
	+ Sample policy data (e.g., "p1", "p2")
	+ Sample user data (e.g., admin, user)
